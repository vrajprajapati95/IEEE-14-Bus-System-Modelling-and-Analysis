# IEEE 14-Bus Power System Analysis Project

## üìò Introduction

This project was undertaken to gain a comprehensive understanding of power system modeling and simulation. The IEEE 14-bus system was selected due to its simplicity and widespread use as a benchmark in academic and research applications. The system comprises 14 buses, 5 generators, and 11 loads, representing a simplified approximation of the American Electric Power system as of February 1962 :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## üîç Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:

- To perform load flow analysis using the IEEE 14-bus system.
- To analyze power losses across different components of the system.
- To study voltage profiles and identify areas requiring voltage control.
- To understand the impact of reactive power compensation on system stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Load Flow Analysis

Load flow analysis was conducted using the Newton-Raphson method to determine the voltage magnitude and angle at each bus, as well as the active and reactive power flows in the system. The analysis provided insights into the operating conditions of the power system under steady-state conditions.

### Power Loss Analysis

The study involved calculating both active (P) and reactive (Q) power losses in transmission lines and transformers. These losses were analyzed to identify components contributing significantly to inefficiencies in the system.

### Voltage Profile Assessment

Voltage levels at each bus were examined to ensure they remained within acceptable limits. Buses exhibiting voltage deviations were identified, and potential solutions such as reactive power compensation were explored.

### Reactive Power Compensation

The impact of reactive power compensation devices, such as shunt capacitors and reactors, was analyzed to assess their effectiveness in improving voltage profiles and reducing losses.

## üìä Results

Key findings from the analysis include:

- Identification of buses with voltage levels outside the acceptable range, indicating the need for voltage control measures.
- Quantification of active and reactive power losses, highlighting areas where system efficiency can be improved.
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of reactive power compensation in enhancing voltage stability and reducing losses.

Detailed results, including tables and graphs, are provided in the accompanying report.
