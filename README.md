# IEEE 14-Bus Power System Analysis Project

## üìò Introduction

This project was undertaken to gain a comprehensive understanding of power system modeling and simulation. The IEEE 14-bus system was selected due to its simplicity and widespread use as a benchmark in academic and research applications. The system comprises 14 buses, 5 generators, and 11 loads, representing a simplified approximation of the American Electric Power system as of February 1962 :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## üîç Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:

- To perform load flow analysis using the IEEE 14-bus system.
- To analyze power losses across different components of the system.
- To study voltage profiles and identify areas requiring voltage control.
- To understand the impact of reactive power compensation on system stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. Power Flow Analysis

We performed load flow studies using the Newton-Raphson method to determine voltage magnitudes, angles, active power (P), and reactive power (Q) at all buses. The study focused on:

Identifying the slack, PV, and PQ buses

Calculating bus voltages and line flows

Detecting areas of under-voltage or overload

2. Loss Evaluation

Using the simulation results, we evaluated:

Active power losses (P Loss) and reactive power losses (Q Loss) across transmission lines

Transformer losses at different voltage levels

Zone-wise and area-wise contribution to system losses

This helped in understanding inefficiencies and areas for potential optimization.

3. Voltage-Level Performance Analysis

The power system was evaluated at various voltage levels (7.8 kV, 13.8 kV, 18 kV, and 69 kV) to determine:

Line-specific and transformer-specific losses

Comparative voltage drop and system behavior under different loads

4. Generation and Load Matching

The simulation ensures total generation matches the total system demand plus losses. We analyzed:

Total active and reactive generation vs load demand

Generator reactive support and system compensation requirements

5. Reactive Power Compensation

We reviewed the need for reactive power compensation using shunt capacitors/inductors to maintain power factor and voltage levels within permissible limits.

6. Economic Considerations (Cost Analysis)

A basic economic assessment was conducted by comparing generator outputs with assumed cost units to understand economic dispatch.

## üìä Results

Key findings from the analysis include:

- Identification of buses with voltage levels outside the acceptable range, indicating the need for voltage control measures.
- Quantification of active and reactive power losses, highlighting areas where system efficiency can be improved.
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of reactive power compensation in enhancing voltage stability and reducing losses.

Detailed results, including tables and graphs, are provided in the accompanying report.
